### Using Energy

Core Coin is a peer to peer network where mining nodes \(peers\) on the network are compensated for sharing the computational load of running the network. Users of the Core Coin blockchain must pay an energy fee anytime they create a transaction on the network.

### Energy Consumption

The total amount of energy a transaction could possibly consume. Any leftover of energy is refunded to the sender.

### Energy Price

The amount of one unit of energy expressed in a Core Coin amount. Think of this as how much energy you need to put into the mass to travel in the universe.

## Transaction Cost

The total amount of Core Coins consumed by the transaction. Multiply the cost of energy used by the energy price.
