This documentation is designed to help you build with the Core Blockchain ecosystem. It covers Core as a concept, its cryptography, explains the Core tech stack, and documents advanced topics for more complex applications and use cases.

This is an open-source community effort, so feel free to suggest new topics, add new content, and provide examples wherever you think it might be helpful. All documentation is editable via GitHub.

## Development Modules

If this is your first attempt at Core development, we recommend starting at the beginning and working your way through like a book.
